# SQL Queries

Apache Cloudberry is built on top of PostgreSQL and follows the SQL standard for data definition, manipulation, and analysis. To define queries effectively, you need to understand the rules that decide SQL syntax and semantics.

This section introduces the key concepts for building SQL queries in Apache Cloudberry, including SQL language structure, value expressions, aggregate and window functions, subqueries, and expression evaluation rules. Each of these areas plays a specific role in enabling accurate, efficient, and expressive queries.

The subtopics linked from this page offer detailed explanations and examples to help you construct SQL queries that work seamlessly with the Cloudberry engine.
