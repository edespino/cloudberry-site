This helps improve query performance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Supports dynamic index-only scan when using the GPORCA optimizer to accelerate queries on partitioned tables. This feature combines partition pruning with index-only access to avoid heap lookups, significantly reducing I/O and improving performance. It is ideal for wide tables with narrow covering indexes and can be enabled using <code>SET optimizer_enable_dynamicindexonlyscan = on</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Supports index-only scans when using the GPORCA optimizer on append-only (AO) tables and PAX tables, enabling faster query execution by avoiding block access when possible. This improves performance in scenarios where traditional index scans on AO and PAX tables were previously inefficient.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"improved-index-scan-performance-and-flexibility\">Improved index scan performance and flexibility<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/whats-new-in-apache-cloudberry-2.0.0#improved-index-scan-performance-and-flexibility\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Improved index scan performance and flexibility\" title=\"Direct link to Improved index scan performance and flexibility\">​</a></h5>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Supports backward index scans when using the GPORCA optimizer for queries with <code>ORDER BY ... DESC</code>, eliminating the need for explicit sorting when a B-tree index exists in the opposite order. This optimization reduces resource usage and improves performance, especially for top-N and pagination queries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The GPORCA optimizer supports triggering Bitmap Index Scans using array comparison predicates like <code>col IN (...)</code> or <code>col = ANY(array)</code>, including for hash indexes. This improves query performance on large datasets by enabling more efficient multi-value matching. The optimizer automatically chooses the bitmap scan path based on cost estimation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The GPORCA optimizer now considers the width of <code>INCLUDE</code> columns when costing index-only scans, favoring narrower indexes that return fewer unused columns. This improves plan selection for queries where multiple covering indexes are available. The cost model also more accurately estimates I/O by refining how <code>relallvisible</code> is used in index-only scan costing.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"brin-index-enhancements\">BRIN index enhancements<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/whats-new-in-apache-cloudberry-2.0.0#brin-index-enhancements\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to BRIN index enhancements\" title=\"Direct link to BRIN index enhancements\">​</a></h5>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Redesigns BRIN index internals for AO/CO tables to replace the <code>UPPER</code> page structure with a more efficient chaining model. This significantly reduces disk space usage for empty indexes and improves performance by avoiding unnecessary page access. The new design better handles the unique layout of AO/CO tables while maintaining correctness and compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>BRIN indexes on AO/CO tables now support summarizing specific logical heap block ranges using <code>brin_summarize_range()</code>, enabling more precise control during index maintenance and testing. This enhancement also adds improved coverage for scenarios involving aborted rows, increasing robustness and correctness in edge cases.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Supports generating <code>IndexScan</code> plans when using the GPORCA optimizer with <code>ScalarArrayOp</code> qualifiers (for example, <code>col = ANY(array)</code>) for B-tree indexes. This enhancement aligns ORCA with the planner's behavior and allows more efficient execution of array comparison queries, as long as the predicate column is the first key in a multicolumn index.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"view-and-materialized-view\">View and materialized view<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/whats-new-in-apache-cloudberry-2.0.0#view-and-materialized-view\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to View and materialized view\" title=\"Direct link to View and materialized view\">​</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improves performance of <code>REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW WITH NO DATA</code> by avoiding full query execution. The command now behaves like a <code>TRUNCATE</code>,significantly reducing execution time while preserving proper dispatch to segments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"join\">Join<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/whats-new-in-apache-cloudberry-2.0.0#join\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Join\" title=\"Direct link to Join\">​</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Supports left join pruning when using the GPORCA optimizer, allowing unnecessary left joins to be eliminated during query optimization. This applies when the query only uses columns from the outer table and the join condition fully covers the inner table's unique or primary keys. This can lead to more efficient query plans.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Supports <code>FULL JOIN</code> using the <code>Hash Full Join</code> strategy when using the GPORCA optimizer. This approach avoids sorting join keys and reduces data redistribution, making it suitable for large datasets or joins on non-aligned distribution keys. All <code>FULL JOIN</code> queries now use <code>Hash Full Join</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The GPORCA optimizer now avoids unnecessary data redistribution for multi-way self joins using left or right outer joins when the join keys are symmetric. This optimization improves performance by recognizing that such joins preserve data colocation, eliminating redundant motion operations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The GPORCA optimizer no longer penalizes broadcast plans for <code>NOT IN</code> queries (Left Anti Semi Join), regardless of the <code>optimizer_penalize_broadcast_threshold</code> setting. This change improves performance and avoids potential OOM issues by enabling parallel execution instead of concentrating large tables on the coordinator node.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"function--aggregate\">Function &amp; aggregate<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/whats-new-in-apache-cloudberry-2.0.0#function--aggregate\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Function &amp; aggregate\" title=\"Direct link to Function &amp; aggregate\">​</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Supports intermediate aggregates when using the GPORCA optimizer, enabling more efficient execution of queries that include both <code>DISTINCT</code> aggregates and regular aggregates. This ensures correct handling of aggregation stages using <code>AGGSPLIT</code>. In addition, ORCA introduces an optimization for <code>MIN()</code> and <code>MAX()</code> functions by using index scans with a limit, instead of full table scans with regular aggregation. This optimization also supports <code>IS NULL</code> and <code>IS NOT NULL</code> conditions on indexed columns, significantly improving performance for applicable queries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enables more <code>HashAggregate</code> plan alternatives for queries that include <code>DISTINCT</code> aggregates when using the GPORCA optimizer. By generating a two-stage aggregation plan that avoids placing <code>DISTINCT</code> functions in hash-based nodes, ORCA ensures compatibility with the executor and expands the range of supported query plans. This improvement enhances optimization choices for group-by queries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Supports queries using <code>GROUP BY CUBE</code>, enabling multi-dimensional grouping sets in query plans. This expands analytic query capabilities. Note that optimization time for <code>CUBE</code> queries may be high due to the large number of generated plan alternatives.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"preprocessing\">Preprocessing<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/whats-new-in-apache-cloudberry-2.0.0#preprocessing\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Preprocessing\" title=\"Direct link to Preprocessing\">​</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Inlines Common Table Expressions (CTEs) that contain outer references, allowing such queries to be planned and explained successfully. Previously, these queries would fall back to the legacy planner due to limitations in handling shared scans with outer references. This change improves compatibility and enables ORCA to optimize a broader range of CTE-based queries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No longer rewrites <code>IN</code> queries to <code>EXISTS</code> when the inner subquery contains a set-returning function. This prevents invalid query transformations that could previously result in execution errors. The change ensures correct handling of queries like <code>a IN (SELECTgenerate_series(1, a))</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"optimization-and-performance-enhancements\">Optimization and performance enhancements<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/whats-new-in-apache-cloudberry-2.0.0#optimization-and-performance-enhancements\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Optimization and performance enhancements\" title=\"Direct link to Optimization and performance enhancements\">​</a></h4>\n<h5 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"dynamic-table\">Dynamic Table<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/whats-new-in-apache-cloudberry-2.0.0#dynamic-table\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Dynamic Table\" title=\"Direct link to Dynamic Table\">​</a></h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduces dynamic tables, a new feature that enables automatic, scheduled refresh of query results. Dynamic tables are similar to materialized views but are designed for scenarios requiring up-to-date data, such as real-time analytics, lakehouse architectures, and automated ETL pipelines.</li>\n<li>Supports creating dynamic tables from base tables, external tables, or materialized views. Users can define refresh intervals using standard cron expressions, ensuring data is kept current without manual intervention.</li>\n<li>For more details, see the <a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/docs/performance/use-dynamic-tables/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">official documentation</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"plan-hint\">Plan hint<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/whats-new-in-apache-cloudberry-2.0.0#plan-hint\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Plan hint\" title=\"Direct link to Plan hint\">​</a></h5>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Supports plan hints for scan types and join row estimates when using the GPORCA optimizer, enabling users to guide query planning using <code>pg_hint_plan</code>-style comments. Supports scan hints include <code>SeqScan</code>, <code>IndexScan</code>, <code>BitmapScan</code>, and their negations, while row hints allow users to specify expected join cardinalities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>plan hint</code> field is now required in the ORCA optimizer configuration. This change simplifies internal parsing logic and ensures consistent handling of optimizer configuration files.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Supports join order hints for left and right outer joins when using the GPORCA optimizer, extending the existing hint framework beyond inner joins. This enhancement allows users to guide the optimizer's join order more precisely in complex queries involving outer joins, improving plan control and potentially execution performance.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"enhancements-to-orca\">Enhancements to ORCA<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/whats-new-in-apache-cloudberry-2.0.0#enhancements-to-orca\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Enhancements to ORCA\" title=\"Direct link to Enhancements to ORCA\">​</a></h5>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Supports table aliases in query plans when using the GPORCA optimizer, making <code>EXPLAIN</code> outputs more descriptive and aligned with user-defined query syntax. In addition, ORCA adds support for query parameters, including those used in functions and prepared statements, enabling better compatibility with parameterized workloads and dynamic SQL execution.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When using the GPORCA optimizer, supports generating plans for queries on tables with row-level security (RLS) enabled. Security policies are enforced during plan generation, ensuring only permitted rows are visible to each user. ORCA still falls back to the planner for RLS queries with sublinks, foreign tables, or for <code>INSERT</code> and <code>UPDATE</code> statements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The GPORCA optimizer now gracefully falls back to the Postgres planner when a function in the <code>FROM</code> clause uses <code>WITH ORDINALITY</code>, which is not currently supported. The fallback includes a clear error message indicating the unsupported feature.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When using the GPORCA optimizer, supports pushing down filters with <code>BETWEEN</code> predicates when combined with constant filters, enabling more effective predicate propagation. This enhancement can reduce the number of rows processed during joins, improving query performance in applicable cases.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When using the GPORCA optimizer, supports hashed subplans when the subquery expression is hashable and contains no outer references. This enhancement can significantly improve query performance by reducing execution time in applicable cases.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ORCA now supports executing foreign tables with <code>mpp_execute='ANY'</code> on either the coordinator or segments, depending on cost. This allows more flexible and efficient execution plans for foreign data sources. A new \"Universal\" distribution type is introduced to support this behavior, similar to how <code>generate_series()</code> is handled.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ORCA now supports direct dispatch for randomly distributed tables when the query includes a filter on <code>gp_segment_id</code>. This enhancement improves query performance by routing execution directly to the relevant segment, reducing unnecessary data processing across the cluster.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ORCA now supports generating plans with the <code>ProjectSet</code> node, enabling correct execution of queries that include set-returning functions (SRFs) in the target list. This enhancement prevents fallback to the legacy planner and ensures compatibility with PostgreSQL 11+ behavior.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ORCA now supports the <code>FIELDSELECT</code> node, which allows it to optimize a broader range of queries involving composite data types. Previously, such queries would fall back to the legacy planner. This enhancement improves compatibility and reduces unnecessary planner fallbacks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ORCA now derives statistics only for the columns used in <code>UNION ALL</code> queries, instead of all output columns from the input tables. This optimization reduces unnecessary computation and can improve planning performance for large queries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Updates naming in logs and <code>EXPLAIN</code> output to refer to the optimizers as \"GPORCA\" and \"Postgres based planner\" for improved clarity and consistency.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Optimizes ORCA's <code>Union All</code> performance by deriving statistics only for columns used in the query output. This reduces unnecessary computation and improves planning efficiency for queries with unused columns.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"transaction-management\">Transaction management<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/whats-new-in-apache-cloudberry-2.0.0#transaction-management\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Transaction management\" title=\"Direct link to Transaction management\">​</a></h3>\n<h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"lock-management\">Lock management<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/whats-new-in-apache-cloudberry-2.0.0#lock-management\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Lock management\" title=\"Direct link to Lock management\">​</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Updates logic to ignore invalidated slots while computing the oldest catalog Xmin, reducing the risk of deadlocks and improving transaction concurrency.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Performs serializable isolation checks early for AO/CO tables, ensuring stricter consistency guarantees and reducing the likelihood of isolation conflicts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enhances the index creation process to prevent deadlocks by ensuring the coordinator acquires an <code>AccessShareLock</code> on <code>pg_index</code> before dispatching a synchronization query to segments, thus aligning <code>indcheckxmin</code> and avoiding conflicts that GDD cannot resolve.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"transaction-performance-and-reliability\">Transaction performance and reliability<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/whats-new-in-apache-cloudberry-2.0.0#transaction-performance-and-reliability\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Transaction performance and reliability\" title=\"Direct link to Transaction performance and reliability\">​</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Avoids replaying DTX information in checkpoints for newly expanded segments, preventing potential inconsistencies during recovery.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adds <code>gp_stat_progress_dtx_recovery</code> for better observability of distributed transaction recovery progress.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improves error reporting for DTX protocol command dispatch errors, making it easier to diagnose and resolve issues.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Allows utility mode on the coordinator to skip upgrading locks for <code>SELECT</code> locking clauses, improving efficiency for maintenance operations.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"storage\">Storage<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/whats-new-in-apache-cloudberry-2.0.0#storage\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Storage\" title=\"Direct link to Storage\">​</a></h3>\n<h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"pax-table-format\">PAX table format<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/whats-new-in-apache-cloudberry-2.0.0#pax-table-format\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to PAX table format\" title=\"Direct link to PAX table format\">​</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduces support for the PAX (Partition Attributes Across) storage format, a hybrid approach that combines the advantages of row-based and column-based storage. PAX is designed to deliver high performance for both data writes and analytical queries, making it well-suited for OLAP workloads and large-scale data analysis.

            "content_html": "<p>The next major release of Apache Cloudberry (Incubating)—version 2.0—is just around the corner. As the project’s first Apache release since joining the Apache Incubator, Cloudberry 2.0 brings a host of new features, performance enhancements, and compliance improvements. While the official release is still in progress, we’d like to share a preview of the most exciting changes and innovations you can expect. This overview highlights the key updates and sets the stage for the upcoming launch.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"key-highlights-of-apache-cloudberry-20\">Key Highlights of Apache Cloudberry 2.0<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/apache-cloudberry-2.0-preview-key-features-and-improvements-ahead#key-highlights-of-apache-cloudberry-20\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Key Highlights of Apache Cloudberry 2.0\" title=\"Direct link to Key Highlights of Apache Cloudberry 2.0\">​</a></h2>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"codebase-cleanup\">Codebase Cleanup<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/apache-cloudberry-2.0-preview-key-features-and-improvements-ahead#codebase-cleanup\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Codebase Cleanup\" title=\"Direct link to Codebase Cleanup\">​</a></h3>\n<p>One of the major efforts in this release was cleaning up the code repository to remove outdated and unused files. This includes legacy components such as Concourse CI configurations (<code>concourse/*</code>), <code>hd-ci/*</code>, legacy deployment directories (e.g., Vagrant and Kubernetes setups), and redundant artifacts like PyGreSQL-related files. This cleanup streamlines the codebase, making it easier for contributors to navigate and focus on meaningful development.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"brand-refresh\">Brand Refresh<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/apache-cloudberry-2.0-preview-key-features-and-improvements-ahead#brand-refresh\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Brand Refresh\" title=\"Direct link to Brand Refresh\">​</a></h3>\n<p>As part of the transition to the Apache Incubator, we’ve unified branding across the project source code and website. References to legacy names like \"Cloudberry Database\" and \"CloudberryDB\" have been replaced with <code>Apache Cloudberry</code> or simply <code>Cloudberry</code>. This ensures consistency and aligns the project with Apache’s branding guidelines.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"compliance-improvements\">Compliance Improvements<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/apache-cloudberry-2.0-preview-key-features-and-improvements-ahead#compliance-improvements\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Compliance Improvements\" title=\"Direct link to Compliance Improvements\">​</a></h3>\n<p>To meet Apache’s licensing and compliance standards, we’ve added the standard Apache License headers to all relevant newly created files by the Cloudberry community, replaced incompatible tarballs like Pylint (GPL-licensed) with Ruff (MIT-licensed), and ensured the codebase passes Apache RAT validation.</p>\n<p>We’ve reworded the NOTICE, LICENSE, DISCLAIMER, COPYRIGHT, and SECURITY files to reflect the new Apache Cloudberry branding and compliance requirements. All submodules and components’ licenses are listed in the top-level <code>licenses</code> directory.</p>\n<p>Our PPMC members and committers have all signed the ICLA (Individual Contributor License Agreement) files and the Cloudberry donation corporation also signed the Software Grant Agreement (SGA) files and and has been filed with the Apache Software Foundation.</p>\n<p>These changes make Cloudberry fully compliant with Apache’s open-source policies, paving the way for a smooth release process.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"cherry-picked-enhancements-from-archived-greenplum\">Cherry-Picked Enhancements from archived Greenplum<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/apache-cloudberry-2.0-preview-key-features-and-improvements-ahead#cherry-picked-enhancements-from-archived-greenplum\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Cherry-Picked Enhancements from archived Greenplum\" title=\"Direct link to Cherry-Picked Enhancements from archived Greenplum\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Apache Cloudberry 2.0 incorporates hundreds of commits cherry-picked from the archived Greenplum repository. These include critical bug fixes, performance improvements, and enhancements to the ORCA query optimizer and other components. While some changes outside Cloudberry’s roadmap were deprioritized, the codebase is now largely aligned with Greenplum, offering a solid foundation for future development. Community contributors are welcome to pick up tasks related to these deprioritized changes. See the <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/cloudberry/discussions/675\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">proposal</a> for more details.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"new-features-and-enhancements\">New Features and Enhancements<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/apache-cloudberry-2.0-preview-key-features-and-improvements-ahead#new-features-and-enhancements\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to New Features and Enhancements\" title=\"Direct link to New Features and Enhancements\">​</a></h3>\n<p>This release introduces new features and enhancements that expand Cloudberry’s capabilities compared to the previous Cloudberry 1.6 release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dynamic Tables: Automatically refresh query results based on base tables, external tables, or materialized views—ideal for building live analytical dashboards. See the <a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/docs/next/performance/use-dynamic-tables\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">doc</a> for more details.</li>\n<li>PAX: Introduces a hybrid row-column storage model that improves cache efficiency and supports both object and local file systems. See the <a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/docs/next/operate-with-data/pax-table-format\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">doc</a> for more details.</li>\n<li>And More: Cloudberry 2.0 brings extensive enhancements across query optimization, the ORCA optimizer, transaction management, storage, data handling, resource managment, and tools. Full details will be available in the official 2.0 release notes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"cicd-process\">CICD Process<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/apache-cloudberry-2.0-preview-key-features-and-improvements-ahead#cicd-process\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to CICD Process\" title=\"Direct link to CICD Process\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Since entering the Apache Incubator, a strong CI/CD pipeline has been established. This pipeline covers all the core tests and checks to ensure the quality of the codebase. At the same time, it can support parallel tests to speed up the CI/CD process, and output the detailed test result parsing and reporting, etc.</p>\n<p>As an Apache Incubator project, Apache Cloudberry 2.0 follows the Apache Software Foundation’s release process, including community discussions, voting, and compliance checks. This ensures the release meets the standards of quality and transparency.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"security-enhancements\">Security Enhancements<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/apache-cloudberry-2.0-preview-key-features-and-improvements-ahead#security-enhancements\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Security Enhancements\" title=\"Direct link to Security Enhancements\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Security has been a top priority for Apache Cloudberry 2.0. We’ve introduced Coverity Scan and SonarQube for automated weekly code analysis, ensuring the codebase is robust and secure.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we’ve addressed critical vulnerabilities, including PostgreSQL CVE-2025-1049 fixes, and upgraded dependencies such as <code>PyYAML</code> to patch known issues. These measures reinforce Cloudberry’s commitment to providing a secure and reliable database platform.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"website-and-docs-updates\">Website and Docs updates<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/apache-cloudberry-2.0-preview-key-features-and-improvements-ahead#website-and-docs-updates\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Website and Docs updates\" title=\"Direct link to Website and Docs updates\">​</a></h3>\n<p>The website and documentation have been updated to reflect the new branding and features. The website now includes a new design, updated content, and better navigation. The documentation has been updated to reflect the new features and changes in the codebase.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"looking-ahead\">Looking Ahead<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/apache-cloudberry-2.0-preview-key-features-and-improvements-ahead#looking-ahead\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Looking Ahead\" title=\"Direct link to Looking Ahead\">​</a></h2>\n<p>As an Apache Incubator project, Cloudberry 2.0 follows the ASF’s rigorous release process, including open discussion, voting, and compliance checks. This ensures transparency, quality, and community trust.</p>\n<p>With a cleaner codebase, enhanced security, and exciting new features and enhancements, Apache Cloudberry 2.0 will be a major milestone that sets the stage for future innovation. We invite the community to join us in shaping the future of Apache Cloudberry by contributing, testing, and sharing feedback.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for the official 2.0 release announcement!

However, with the archiving of the open-source Greenplum Database and a complete shutdown of its community, original open-source Greenplum users cannot get the security or feature updates for free anymore which results in potential challenges for their business.</p>\n<p>We want to make Cloudberry the primary open-source alternative to the original Greenplum open-source version. We hope all open-source developers and users of Greenplum will migrate to Cloudberry.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"the-story-of-cloudberry\">The Story of Cloudberry<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/cloudberry-database-enters-the-apache-incubator#the-story-of-cloudberry\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to The Story of Cloudberry\" title=\"Direct link to The Story of Cloudberry\">​</a></h2>\n<p>Before going further, we would like to recap the history of the Greenplum Database from closed-source to open-source (October 2015) and then going closed-source (May 2024):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Greenplum Database has a long history back to 2003 when it was originally developed based on Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) architecture and the PostgreSQL technology by a company called Greenplum Inc.</li>\n<li>In 2010, Greenplum Inc. was acquired by EMC Corporation.</li>\n<li>In 2012, EMC and VMware (a subsidiary of EMC) combined several of their software assets, including Greenplum Database, into a new company called Pivotal Software, Inc.</li>\n<li>In 2015, Pivotal open sourced the Greenplum’s core engine and rebranded it as Pivotal Greenplum Database®, which became the first open-source MPP data warehouse. The open-source core of the Pivotal Greenplum Database® was used to initiate Apache HAWQ and Apache MADlib projects, while the Greenplum itself remained a single vendor open-source project.</li>\n<li>In 2019, VMware acquired Pivotal Software. This acquisition brought the Pivotal Greenplum Database® back into VMware. VMware continued to support the Greenplum Database development and its open-source community and provided VMware Tanzu Greenplum as the commercial product in the following years.</li>\n<li>In November 2023, Broadcom completed its acquisition of VMware and Greenplum is under Broadcom<sup><a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/cloudberry-database-enters-the-apache-incubator#user-content-fn-2-347664\" id=\"user-content-fnref-2-347664\" data-footnote-ref=\"true\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">2</a></sup>.</li>\n<li>In May 2024, nearly all Greenplum’s GitHub repos were archived and became read-only, the Slack workspace was deleted (<a href=\"https://greenplum.slack.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://greenplum.slack.com</a>), and both <code>user</code><sup><a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/cloudberry-database-enters-the-apache-incubator#user-content-fn-3-347664\" id=\"user-content-fnref-3-347664\" data-footnote-ref=\"true\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">3</a></sup> and <code>dev</code><sup><a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/cloudberry-database-enters-the-apache-incubator#user-content-fn-4-347664\" id=\"user-content-fnref-4-347664\" data-footnote-ref=\"true\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">4</a></sup> community email lists went silent. These are done by its latest owner without any announcements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can see that the ownership of Greenplum Database has changed many times over the past many years, which has raised concerns among the community users, developers, and ecosystem partners. Being controlled by one single vendor, Greenplum has lacked an open governance model that allows community participation in the decision-making process.</p>\n<p>The Cloudberry builders recognized that the Greenplum Database had lost its drive for innovation and major feature updates for a long time. Greenplum became less competitive compared to newer generation open-source data warehouses and analytics projects.</p>\n<p>Cloudberry was launched in 2022 by the original Greenplum developers, and its source code was made open in 2023. We were surprised when Greenplum suddenly shifted to a closed-source model, which was quite dramatic. From that point on, we were determined to continue our mission and reunite the original open-source Greenplum developers and users, shaping our project in a community way.</p>\n<p>Cloudberry is not only simply remade with a different brand. It comes with a fantastic vision and ships a lot of advanced features and highlights, including a newer PostgreSQL kernel, enhanced security, end-to-end performance optimization, supporting AI/ML workloads and streaming, lakehouse integration, and more. We aim to keep Cloudberry compatible with Greenplum to let users use Cloudberry the way they were using Greenplum.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"why-apache-incubator\">Why Apache Incubator?<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/cloudberry-database-enters-the-apache-incubator#why-apache-incubator\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Why Apache Incubator?\" title=\"Direct link to Why Apache Incubator?\">​</a></h2>\n<p>Joining the Apache Incubator is a major step for Cloudberry as it opens the door for collaboration, community growth, and innovation within the open-source world. The Apache Incubator provides a framework for the governance, mentoring, and management of open-source projects, ensuring the project’s growth while aligning with the Apache Way—a community-driven development model that emphasizes transparency and open collaboration.</p>\n<p>As Cloudberry enters the Incubator, we are more committed than ever to fostering a vibrant, diverse developer community and encouraging contributions from across the globe. Cloudberry will now have the opportunity to benefit from the mentorship of experienced Apache community members.
